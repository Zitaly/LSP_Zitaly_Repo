   * Cat. 3
   * T1. If Category = Electronics; price *= 0.90. Rounded to two decimals.
   * T2. Ask professor if this is the same as the standardization in that the first letter is capitalized. "NAME" vs "Name"
   * T3. If Price > 500; Category = Premium Electronics
   * T4. Same implementation as a grade scale. High to low
   * T5. Look at chars. First cut down on leading and tailing space. Char 0, find space in middle, then char right after that.
