Given:
The library maintains a collection of books, each having a title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
Members of the library can borrow books if they are available. 
Each member can borrow only up to 3 books at a time.  
When a member returns a book, it should become available again.  
Librarians can add new books to the collection and remove books that are outdated or lost.  
The system must allow the librarian to view the list of available books and see which books are currently checked out and who has borrowed them.
